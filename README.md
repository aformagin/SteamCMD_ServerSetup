# SteamCMD_ServerSetup
Quick set up scripts I wrote for setting up SteamCMD and downloading game files.  

Currently included games/configs:
- ARK Survival Evolved (Custom Config & Start Script)

### TODO
- Split SteamCMD script into 2 parts (user creation & SteamCMD install)
- Test ARK:SE scripts
- Add Valheim scripts to list
- Write basic instructions
